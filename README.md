# VALORANT TEAM API

This is the backend of a Valorant team player-management system. It
features interaction with a database of players created using MySQL. Every line
of code is explained in great detail, with the aim of going in more depth than
traditional method headers and alike.

NOTE: This is still largely a WIP. There are lots of features and error-handling 
left to implement as well as some bugs that need to be fixed.
